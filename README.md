# About this article
I found this paragraph interesting because it makes me become more productive if I use these tools when I am programming (Although this is not allowed in the courses) .

# Comment from Michael Han
It's fascinating to see how your toolkit as a software engineer evolves, blending cutting-edge AI like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT with more traditional tools like Kindle and Excalidraw. Your shift towards AI-driven solutions, especially for code generation and problem-solving, marks a significant step in the tech world. It's like you're on a digital surfboard, riding the colossal wave of AI, while still anchoring yourself with the solid, proven tools like Kindle for knowledge absorption. Your approach seems to blend the best of both worlds, harnessing the dynamism of AI while maintaining the stability of tried-and-true methods. It's a tech symphony, where AI and traditional tools harmonize, each playing its unique part in elevating your productivity and creativity. Truly, your toolbox is a vivid example of the seamless integration of future-forward tech with the foundational pillars of software engineering.
